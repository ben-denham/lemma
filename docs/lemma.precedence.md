# lemma.precedence

This module defines the relative levels of precedence for LaTeX
strings that may be generated by Lemma forms.

| Precedence level | Purpose |
| - | - |
| <nobr>BASE-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Lowest level of precedence, never needs to be wrapped in parentheses. Applies to e.g. paren-wrapped expressions, identifiers. |
| <nobr>NUMERIC-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Applies to numeric values (e.g. 1, 1.4, -5). |
| <nobr>UNARY-OP-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Unary operators (e.g. roots, floor, ceil). |
| <nobr>EXPONENT-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Expressions with an exponent. |
| <nobr>FRACTION-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Fractions, as formatted with `\frac`. |
| <nobr>JUXT-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Multiplication by juxtaposition (e.g. `xy`). |
| <nobr>FUNCTION-CALL-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Function calls (e.g. `max(0, 1)`). |
| <nobr>BINARY-OP-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Binary operators. Distinction between the precedences of addition+subtraction and multiplication+division is not made, as dependence on precedences is considered to reduce readability. |
| <nobr>SUMMATION-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Summation/product precedences (e.g. Big sigma, Big Pi). |
| <nobr>EQUATION-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Equations/assignments formatted as an `=` binary operation. |
| <nobr>MAX-PRECEDENCE</nobr> | Defines the maximum known precedence. |
